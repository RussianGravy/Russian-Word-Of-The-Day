# "Russian Word Of The Day" email server

Sends an email daily with three new Russian words to improve my learning habits.

## Description

A Cronjob on my Raspberry Pi executes main.py at 6 am daily. The program selects the first two lines in words.txt (which contains thirty Russian words generated by Gemini every two weeks) and sends them in an email using the Gmail SMTP server.
